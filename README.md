# hello-world
Generic starter repository

I am a junior **Murray State** _Racer_ named **_David Jimenez_**.

My ~~form of torture~~ major is _Computer Science_ and I am hoping to be a **_Data Analyst_** after I receive my degree.

This is my first time taking **CSC430** and I'm pretty excited to learn how to format my code and program cleanly.

I have two other Github accounts: My Personal **@DJimLut** and My Work **@NAS-DJimLut**.

A fun fact about me is that I traveled out of the country before I traveled out of state.
